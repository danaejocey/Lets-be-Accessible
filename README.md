# Lets be Accessible

The motivation behind my project is to make the webiste Accessible Friendly.

I left comments on my changes for the next coder to see how I made the webiste accessible already and they can improve it as well.

I attempted to clean the CSS though I found myself struggling with the classes. I knew there were several classes but they had the 
saem css style but I couldn't figure out how to connect them to create a more organized css.

I built this program because accessible friendly websites should be a norm rather than something that needs to be asked for by 
customer or clients.
